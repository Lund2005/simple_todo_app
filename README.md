  - put list view in safe area (currently collides with phone navigation bar)
  - animate tasks smoothly
  - fix adding bar lagging when keyboard appears
  -fix gap when deleting task
- add different buttons for category filtering at the top (with "All tasks" as the default state)
- auto delete task after they have been finished for a certain time
