# simple_todo_app

## Description
A simple todo app with the intention to learn flutter's basic local storage systems.

## Next steps
- user should not be able to edit a tasks name to an empty string
- integrate local storage system for todos

## Possible further stuff
- add task category and description
- add different buttons for category filtering at the top (with "All tasks" as the default state)
- focus on user interface and experience
  - make phone bar at top transparent and invert colors (dark icons)
  - make adding textfield not autoselect after editing a task on mobile
  - click animation for editing tasks
  - improve check animation (currently not visible due to 'finished tasks' grouping)
  - increase dragging handle size
  - animate widgets smoothly
  - fix adding bar lagging when keyboard appears
  - fix gap when deleting task
  - box shadow when reordering tasks
- clean up code, extract as much as possible in individual scripts/widgets
