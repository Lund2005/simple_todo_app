# simple_todo_app

## Description
A simple todo app with the intention to learn flutter's basic local storage systems.

## Next steps
- build functionalities (edit todos, remove todos)
  - use smooth pop-up window to edit and view tasks by clicking on a task
    - include task description
  - swipe to remove a task directly
  - group task by active and completed tasks
- integrate local storage system for todos

## Possible further stuff
- focus on user interface and experience
  - animate tasks smoothly
  - drag and drop tasks to customly sort them
- add tags and urgency to tasks
  - sort task options (urgency, date...)
- auto delete task after they have been finished for a certain time
