# simple_todo_app

## Description
A simple todo app with the intention to learn flutter's basic local storage systems.

## Next steps
- build functionalities (edit todos)
  - use smooth pop-up window to edit and view tasks by clicking on a task
  - include task category and importancy
- integrate local storage system for todos
- add different buttons for category filtering at the top (with "All tasks" as the default state)
- clean up code
  - extract enhanced list view into own widget and script

## Possible further stuff
- focus on user interface and experience
  - increase dragging handle size
  - put list view in safe area (currently collides with phone navigation bar)
  - animate widgets smoothly
  - fix adding bar lagging when keyboard appears
  - fix gap when deleting task
  - box shadow when reordering tasks
- auto delete task after they have been finished for a certain time
