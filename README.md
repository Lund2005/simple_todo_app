# simple_todo_app

## Description
A simple todo app with the intention to learn flutter's basic local storage systems.

## Next steps
- edit task importancy, category and description
- fix text overflow on long tasks
- show task importancy and category (and maybe decription in task list)

- integrate local storage system for todos

- add different buttons for category filtering at the top (with "All tasks" as the default state)

- clean up code
  - extract enhanced list view into own widget and script

## Possible further stuff
- focus on user interface and experience
  - make phone bar at top transparent and invert colors (dark icons)
  - make adding textfield not autoselect after editing a task on mobile
  - click animation for editing tasks
  - improve check animation (currently not visible due to 'finished tasks' grouping)
  - increase dragging handle size
  - animate widgets smoothly
  - fix adding bar lagging when keyboard appears
  - fix gap when deleting task
  - box shadow when reordering tasks
